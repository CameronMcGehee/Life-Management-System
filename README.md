# UltiScape

Ultiscape will be an easy-to-use yet fully functional web app for fully automating a lawn/landscaping service business. It will offer:

- Customer Management
- Property Management
- Job Management
- Invoice Management
- Estimate Management
- Equipment/Inventory Tracking
- Chemical Inventory and Application Tracking
- Staff Management
- Crew Management
- Payroll Tracking

- Custom website for your business and customer portal for your customers to access their scheduled jobs, invoices, pay online, and more.
- Self-Hosted version fully configurable to your own needs

UltiScape is open source, so you can either install it on your own hosting environment, or use it at UltiScape.com with a subscription fee or lifetime access purchase (to pay for hosting). Donations will also be accepted at ultiscape.com.

It will be designed to be as speedy as possible, which means there will be limited libraries used, no bloated javascript frameworks etc. It will be mostly PHP/HTML/CSS from scratch apart from very small amounts of jQuery for working with dynamic HTML (popups, for example) and async functions.
