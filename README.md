# UltiScape

Ultiscape is planned to be a one-stop site for full automation when operating a lawn/landscaping service business. It will offer:

- Customers
- Properties
- Jobs
- Invoices
- Estimates
- Equipment/Inventory
- Chemical Inventory and Application Tracking
- Staff
- Crews
- Payroll
- Custom website for your business and customer portal for your customers to access their scheduled jobs, invoices, pay online, and more.
- Self-Hosted version fully configurable to your own needs

The idea is to allow you to either install it on your own hosting environment, or use it at UltiScape.com with a subscription fee or lifetime access purchase. Donations will also be accepted on https://www.ultiscape.com. I feel safe offering it for download since most lawn/landscaping business owners will most likely get the subscription/lifetime ultiscape.com access due to the likelyhood that they are not super tech-savy and will not bother trying to host and install it themselves.

It will be designed to be as speedy as possible, which means there will be limited libraries used, no bloated javascript frameworks etc. It will be mostly PHP/HTML/CSS from scratch apart from very small amounts of jQuery for working with dynamic HTML (popups, for example) and async functions.
