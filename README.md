# UltiScape

Ultiscape is planned to be a one-stop site for full automation when operating a lawn/landscaping service business. It will offer features pertaining to:

- Customers
- Properties
- Jobs
- Invoices
- Estimates
- Equipment/Inventory
- Chemical Inventory and Application Tracking
- Staff
- Crews
- Payroll

It will be designed to be as speedy as possible, which means there will be limited libraries used, no bloated javascript frameworks etc. It will be 100% from scratch apart from very small amounts of jQuery for working with html and async functions.

# Dev To-do List

- The main database still needs to be completed. For the sake intelectual property rights and functionality of the site, I will not release the exact database structure and code will not be made to build it. I'll be working on this for a while since it's quite a few tables that need to be added. Until then, just use the functions defined as managers in the lib/app folder since there is a manager class for each group of tables to retrieve data related to them.

- Admin business selection page
