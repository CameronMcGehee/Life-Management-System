    // Thank you for using Ultiscape! This index.php file is for you to create your own business-specific landing page if you have self-hosted UltiScape.
    // UltiScape is designed so that you can have your business landing page, and then /admin, /staff, and /customer for the respective UltiScape-managed areas.
    
    // Therefore, it is recommended to use THIS directory for your main busines website so that you do not have mysite.com/dir/admin,
    // but rather a more concise, mysite.com/[admin|customer|staff].

    // If you are using your own website for your business landing page or do not want to use this landing page, simply set up a redirect from this page to the admin,
    // customer, or staff page by uncommenting the corresponding line below (whichever you want this directory to point to by default)

    // header("location: ./admin");
    // header("location: ./customer");
    // header("location: ./staff");
